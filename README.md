IPSet
=====

IPSet is a PHP class for matching IP addresses against a set of CIDR
specifications. It was extracted from MediaWiki core in 2014,
and moved to the [wikimedia/ip-utils](https://packagist.org/packages/wikimedia/ip-utils)
package in 2023.

**Replace use of `wikimedia/ip-set` with `wikimedia/ip-utils` 5.0.0 or later**.
